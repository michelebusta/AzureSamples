Sample Setup

To run locally:
- edit hosts file in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc to add these entries:
127.255.0.1    abc.bustacloud.com
127.255.0.1    xyz.bustacloud.com

- note that both web projects have a pre and post build event
pre-build event is to delete \Sites subdirectory
post-build event deploys each web site to the \Sites directory

this is based on comments shown in this post which discuss how to automate publish and deploy of compiled sites

- run the cloud service and go!

To deploy and run:
- replace bustacloud with your own domain
- remove the hosts file entry so DNS can resolve
- publish to Azure, production slot
- point your domain at the production IP address
create two A records one for * and another for @ to point to your IP
- you should be able to browse to abc. and xyz. at your domain
